  abstract = {Commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning support a wide variety of potential applications in fields such as document auto-categorization, Web search enhancement, topic gisting, social process modeling, and concept-level opinion and sentiment analysis. Solutions to these problems, however, demand robust knowledge bases capable of supporting flexible, nuanced reasoning. Populating such knowledge bases is highly time-consuming, making it necessary to develop techniques for deconstructing natural language texts into commonsense concepts. In this work, we propose an approach for effective multi-word commonsense expression extraction from unrestricted English text, in addition to a semantic similarity detection technique allowing additional matches to be found for specific concepts not already present in knowledge bases.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new algorithm for K-medoids clustering which runs like the K-means algorithm and tests several methods for selecting initial medoids. The proposed algorithm calculates the distance matrix once and uses it for finding new medoids at every iterative step. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we use some real and artificial data sets and compare with the results of other algorithms in terms of the adjusted Rand index. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm takes a significantly reduced time in computation with comparable performance against the partitioning around medoids.}
